# Setup Instructions

### Windows/MSVC
If you have MSVC installed on your system. Well you are already done with the setup.   
Just clone the repository, open the folder with "Open Folder" option.   
Alternatively, generate the solution file for your VS version from cmake scripts.

### Windows/CLang
You can install LLVM from (http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#9.0.0).   
You would also need CMake.   
You can use any text editor or your choice. Recommended VSCode.   
-->> Add "launch.json" for debuggin support in this configuration.

### Linux/GCC
Install GCC, CMake, VSCode.

### Mac/CLang
You don't really deserve to write C++ code.   
But you can still use CLang, CMake, "your preferred code editor".
